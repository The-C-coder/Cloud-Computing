# Cloud-Computing
A full description of all the topics of cloud computing.

A Brief History-The idea of computing in a "cloud" traces back to the origins of utility computing a concept ,a concept that computer scientist 'John Mccarthy' publicly proposed in 1961.
Definitions - "...a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using internet Technologies.
The definition that recieved industry wide - acceptance was composed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) "cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitious , convenient , on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction".

a more precise definition is " Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning sacalable and measured resources".
There are four basics business drivers for cloud computing -
1 - capacity planning 
 a)Lead startegy - adding capacity to an IT resource in  anticipation of demand.
 b)Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity.
 c)Match startegy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments , as demand increases.

2 - cost reduction
3 - Organizational Agility - organizational agility is the measure of an organization's responsiveness to change.
Technology Innovations 
a) Clustering - A cluster is a group of independent IT resources that are interconnected and work as a single system.
b) Grid Computing - A computing grid provides a platform in which computing resources are organized into one or more logical pools.Grid computing systems differs from clustering in such manner that the grid systems are much more loosely coupled and distributed.
4 - Virtualization - Virtualization represents a technology platform used for the creation of virtual instances of IT resources.

Now we are moving towrads the main topic what is cloud?

A cloud refers to distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning sacalable and measured IT resources.
